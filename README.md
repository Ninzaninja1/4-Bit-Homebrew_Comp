# 4-Bit-Homebrew_Comp
A Homebrew computer built mainly using only the fundamental logic gates. This is a 4-Bit computer using the SAP-1 architecture.

I am using the application Digital by hneemann to simulate the computer.

## Progress
Here are some screenshots of the progress:

- RAM Module, consisting of RAM, MAR and MDR:
